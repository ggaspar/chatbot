**ATTENTION**

If your webhook returns an error (i.e., not a 2XX status) or times out (i.e., takes longer than 20 second to respond) for over 15 minutes, then we will send you a warning developer alert.

If your webhook continues to fail for 8 hours, then we will send you a developer alert that the webhook is being disabled and we will unsubscribe your app. Once you've fixed your issues, you must re-add your webhook and re-subscribe your app to the page.
